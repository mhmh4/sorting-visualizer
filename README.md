## Introduction

This visualizer renders sorting algorithms being performed on randomly generated arrays in real-time.

The length of each rectangle and the rectangle count are proportional to the dimensions of the
screen which can be modified in `settings.py`.

Sorting algorithms implemented:

  - Bubble sort
  - Counting sort
  - Heapsort
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort
  - Odd-even sort
  - Quicksort
  - Selection sort

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+

## Dependencies
- Pygame 2.5.0
